# Software Engineering Interview Questions in Python

This repository was supposed to be a guide on data structures, algorithms, software design & Co. in Python. However, it is incomplete.

I started to create it while following the learning path [Ace the Python Coding Interview](https://www.educative.io/path/ace-python-coding-interview) in [educative.io](educative.io). The path is divided in 7 modules, which I will add as I complete them:

1. Data Structures
2. Algorithms
3. Recursion
4. Dynamic Programming
5. Object Oriented Design
6. System Design
7. Concurrency

:warning: **However, I decided to discontinue this respository**.

Analternative repositories of mine which cover some of the related topics are:

- [data_structures_algorithms_udemy](https://github.com/mxagar/data_structures_algorithms_udemy). I created that repository while following the Udemy course [Python for Algorithms, Data-Structures, and Interviews](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-structures-algorithms-and-interviews), by J.M. Portilla.
- [design_patterns_notes](https://github.com/mxagar/design_patterns_notes). I created that repository while following the Udemy course [Design Patterns in Python](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-patterns-python/), by D. Nesteruk.
