# Software Engineering Interview Questions in Python

This repository deals with data structures, algorithms, software design & Co. in python.

I created it while following the learning path [Ace the Python Coding Interview](https://www.educative.io/path/ace-python-coding-interview) in [educative.io](educative.io).

The path is divided in 7 modules:

1. Data Structures
2. Algorithms
3. Recursion
4. Dynamic Programming
5. Object Oriented Design
6. System Design
7. Concurrency
